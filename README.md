## Insights

1. Based on the analysis of the dataset, it was found that a significiant portion of respondents, particularly those aged between 25 and 34, participated in the survey. This suggests that individuals within this group are predominant users of decluttering platforms.
   
2. Out of the respondents, 69 individuals stated that they don't encounter challenges with decluttering. However, 32 persons expressed difficulties in finding buyers for their products, while others reported facing issues related to low pricing. Utilizing this decluttering application could potentially address these challenges and facilitate improved sales of products, thereby mitigating issues related to finding buyers and pricing concerns.

3. In the analysis of awareness regarding second-hand platforms, approximately 78 individuals stated that they do not currently utilize any platform for decluttering purposes. Conversely, 15 respondents reported using Jiji for decluttering. This highlights the significant potential and importance of the decluttering application, particularly in providing a solution for those who currently lack a platform for decluttering their belongings.

##    CONCLUSION

In conclusion, the analysis revealed significant insights that underscore the importance and potential impact of developing a decluttering application.

Regional Preferences: Locations such as Lagos and Anambra show a notable interest in decluttering, with specific age groups and frequency patterns(particularly women, fell within the age range of 25-34).

Disposal Methods and Challenges: There's a diverse range of disposal methods used by respondents, with a significant number expressing challenges in finding buyers or managing pricing.

Awareness of Second-hand Platforms: A considerable proportion of respondents currently lack a platform for decluttering, indicating a significant market gap that our application could fill.

Reasons for Decluttering: Respondents declutter for various reasons, including seasonal cleaning, the need for more space, and preparation for moving or migration.

These findings collectively highlight the opportunity and demand for a decluttering application that addresses the diverse needs and preferences of users. By incorporating these insights into the development process, we can create a robust platform that not only simplifies the decluttering process but also fosters a positive user experience and promotes sustainable practices.
